# Introduction
This book is a resource for R programming for beginners. Each chapter is a tutorial. I highly recommend cementing your knowledge in programming basics and data types (chapters 3 and 4) as a foundation for any type of downstream analysis in R.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_app("https://kazeera.shinyapps.io/learn-r-shiny/",
  height = "400px")

```

**Each chapter contains:**

* description of concept
* examples of concept
* link to quiz
* practice problem and solution

**What is programming/coding?** 

It is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. It can be done using a variety of computer "languages," such as R, Java, and python. 

**Advantages of R?**

Here are some benefits of R programming for both beginners and experts.

* R is **open-source**, free and accessible (no license/subscription required!). In addition, the R community is very active, helpful and build extensive libraries that may suit your needs.
* Supports **cross-platform** usage (ie. machine-independent), which means it can be used on Windows, Mac OS, etc. the same way.
* It is an **interpreted language**, meaning you can see the output of your code line-by-line. In other words, it doesn't need a compiler to make executable programs. R is also an object-oriented programming language.

**Why should you learn R?**

R has a comprehensive development environment, which will help you perform statistical computing as well as software development.

1. Delve into **statistical computing and analysis**
2. Analyze **large data sets** for data science via parallel/distributed computing.
3. Great for **data cleansing and wrangling**.
4. Produce **powerful graphics**, that is, high quality visualizations, even interactive graphs!
5. Compatible with **other languages** such as C, C++, FORTRAN as well as Java, Python.
6. Use to **interact with databases** such as MySQL.
7. Perform **machine learning**.
8. Create **web applications** without any web development knowledge using RShiny.
